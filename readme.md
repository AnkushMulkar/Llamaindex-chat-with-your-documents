# Chat with the Custom Docs using LlamaIndex

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a chatbot that can answer technical questions about the Streamlit Python library. The chatbot leverages the LlamaIndex and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to provide accurate and technical responses based on the indexed Streamlit documentation.

## Techniques

The following techniques and tools are used in this project:

- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework used to create the web interface for the chatbot.
- **LlamaIndex**: A tool used to index and search through documents efficiently.
- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo**: A language model used to generate responses based on the indexed documentation.
- **Python**: The backend code for the app is written in Python, utilizing various libraries and frameworks.

## Features

- **Document Indexing**: The Streamlit documentation is indexed using LlamaIndex to facilitate efficient searching.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot through a chat interface integrated into the Streamlit app.
- **Technical Responses**: The chatbot is designed to provide technical and fact-based responses, avoiding hallucination of features.
- **Chat History**: The chat history is maintained in the Streamlit session state, allowing users to view the entire conversation.

## Conclusion

This Streamlit app creates an interactive chatbot that can answer technical questions about the Streamlit Python library based on indexed documentation. It showcases the power of combining a language model with indexed data to provide accurate and technical responses to user queries.
